// Package diff compares two documents: the exported API of every package and

//
// A symbol is keyed by import path, receiver and name, so it is found across
// revisions whichever file it moved to. A signature is compared with its
// parameter names stripped, because renaming a parameter changes no caller.
// Breaking is a removed or changed exported symbol, or a field moved on an
// exported type; what --include-unexported surfaces is reported but never
// breaking, and neither is a go.mod change.

// worktree reads the JSON of "splint diff" for its release verdicts, so the
